 **ELK Stack** (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) does â€” in a **clear and practical way**:

---

### âœ… **E â†’ Elasticsearch**
> **Job:** Stores, searches, and analyzes logs.

- Acts like a **powerful search engine + database**.
- All your logs are finally sent and stored here.
- You can **query and filter** logs lightning-fast.

ðŸ§  Think of it as:  
ðŸ“¦ A smart warehouse where all logs are stored and organized.

---

### âœ… **L â†’ Logstash**
> **Job:** Collects, processes, and forwards logs to Elasticsearch.

- It **ingests logs** from different sources (apps, servers, containers).
- Can **filter, clean, enrich** logs (e.g., remove passwords, add tags).
- Sends cleaned logs to **Elasticsearch**.

ðŸ§  Think of it as:  
ðŸ§¹ A cleaning and routing machine for raw log data.

---

### âœ… **K â†’ Kibana**
> **Job:** Visualizes logs stored in Elasticsearch.

- You can **view logs in a UI**, create dashboards, charts, alerts.
- Helps DevOps/SRE teams **spot issues quickly**.
- Works directly on top of Elasticsearch.

ðŸ§  Think of it as:  
ðŸ“Š A beautiful dashboard that helps you see whatâ€™s going on.

### ðŸ§© Flow in 1 Line:

`Logstash` â†’ (cleans + sends logs) â†’ `Elasticsearch` â†’ (stores logs) â†’ `Kibana` (visualizes logs)
